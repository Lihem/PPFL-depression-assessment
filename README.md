# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for Depression Assessment
## Abstract:
Depression is a serious illness affecting millions worldwide. However, the detection of depression has been a challenging area for machine learning (ML) researchers due to the lack of available medical data, which is often strictly private. To address the data sparsity problem and detect depression without compromising medical privacy, we aim to use federated learning. E-DAIC dataset is used in our study and audio modality is utilized. For the preprocessing, weighted random sampling method is used for balancing the data and MFCC coefficients are extracted afterwards. A centralized baseline model was initially developed and then transferred to the federated scheme. In the 4-client scenario, the performance loss from the centralized model was tolerable. However, in the 8-client scenario, the results were not satisfactory. It is important to note that in real-world scenarios, as the number of clients increases, that would result in more data and potentially different outcomes.
